-  Hi, -. I have a love for optimization. 
-  currently operating in C, C++, x86-64 asm. Optimizations important!
-  working on low-level optimization, for improving use of low power hardware.
-  Have studied low level languages, and advanced memory usage, looking foward to optimizing NN memory usage.
